# Wordle solver
    Using statistical analysis and image processing to create an agent capable of solving wordle with minimal human assistance.

# TO DO:
- add image processing
- optimize the code for repetitive letters
- add bot to automatically input guesses and restart the game

# Finised:
- Word scoring algorithm based on statistical analysis

# Consider:
- Using the wordle hidden words list to form guesses instead of the valid words list
    - Pros:
      - Possibly faster convergence to guesses
    - Cons:
      - no future proofing if the list gets expanded
      - kind of cheaty
